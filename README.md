# 🧠 Depression and Suicide Risk Detection using Machine Learning

This project leverages advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques to enable **early detection of depression and suicidal ideation**, primarily through analysis of textual data from digital sources.

## 🚀 Motivation

Mental health disorders, particularly depression and suicidal tendencies, are escalating global issues. Traditional diagnosis methods—relying on self-reporting and clinical evaluation—often fail to identify early warning signs. This project was motivated by the need for **automated, real-time systems** that can flag mental health concerns at an early stage, offering a chance for timely intervention and support.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Approach

- **NLP & Deep Learning Models**: Bi-LSTM, CNN, SVM, and Transformer-based models like BERT were used to classify mental health indicators in text.
- **Dataset**: Social media posts and forums provided linguistic data to train classifiers on patterns associated with depression and suicidal ideation.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines CNN and RNN architectures to enhance classification accuracy by capturing both local and sequential features in text.

## 📊 Results & Evaluation

This section presents a summary of the model evaluation, demonstrating the system’s effectiveness in detecting suicidal ideation, anxiety, and depression using deep learning models.

### 🎯 Objective

The goal was to assess the performance of the proposed machine learning system in identifying individuals at mental health risk through text classification. The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In addition, the system's usability—especially through the web interface and interpretative message generation—was analyzed to determine its practicality for real-world applications.

### 📈 BiLSTM Model Performance

The BiLSTM model was trained over 10 epochs for binary classification (Suicide vs No Suicide):

- The model showed consistently increasing training and validation accuracy with decreasing loss.
- The confusion matrix indicates excellent performance with high true positives and true negatives, and well-balanced false predictions.
